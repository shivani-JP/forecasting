TIMESERIES ANALYSIS ON ATM WITHDRAWLS 
The project is split into two parts:

1. PART1 Contains Exploratory data analysis
   
   a)  The time series data was thoroughly explored and analysed to identify patterns inherent in  real-world time series data. The findings were documented, and a comprehensive technical report was prepared, incorporating informative graphs to substantiate key arguments.
   b)  Upon examination, the dataset revealed an additive trend and multiplicative seasonality, with an additional weekly seasonality identified through rigorous analysis. Statistical tests were employed to supplement visual analysis, facilitating the interpretation of results and addressing any discrepancies. Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) graphs were generated and examined.
   c)  In conclusion, a summary of patterns observed across all individual time series within the group was provided. Commonalities and differences among the time series patterns were analyzed, considering their similarity or dissimilarity, and implications for the automated forecasting of similar time series data were discussed.


3. PART2 Contains machine learning models for acurate forecasting
   
  a)  Constructed and evaluated seven forecasting models, including exponential smoothing, ARIMA, linear regression, and neural networks.
  b)  Assessed model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, AIC, and BIC, alongside time series cross-validation techniques.
  c)  Compared model performance against Naïve and Seasonal Naïve models to determine the best-fit model for forecasting ATM withdrawal data.
