## PART 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

1. **Exploration and Analysis:**
   - Thoroughly explored and analyzed time series data to identify inherent patterns in real-world data.
   - Documented findings and prepared a comprehensive technical report with informative graphs.

2. **Identified Patterns:**
   - Revealed an additive trend and multiplicative seasonality in the dataset.
   - Discovered additional weekly seasonality through rigorous analysis.
   - Employed statistical tests to supplement visual analysis and addressed any discrepancies.
   - Generated and examined Autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) graphs.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Provided a summary of patterns observed across all individual time series within the group.
   - Analyzed commonalities and differences among time series patterns, discussing implications for automated forecasting.

## PART 2: Machine Learning Models for Accurate Forecasting

1. **Model Construction and Evaluation:**
   - Constructed and evaluated seven forecasting models, including exponential smoothing, ARIMA, linear regression, and neural networks.

2. **Performance Assessment:**
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, AIC, and BIC, alongside time series cross-validation techniques.

3. **Model Comparison:**
   - Compared model performance against Naïve and Seasonal Naïve models to determine the best-fit model for forecasting ATM withdrawal data.
